## Project synopsis
"Let's plant" is an app meant to be used by anyone who has a green thumb. The app acts as a pocket calendar for gardeners/horticulturists/florists. Choose your "way" of the green thumb, select the tasks you're interested in and keep track of them on the calendar.

## Current state of the project

This project was forgotten for a long time (approx. 5 months) as it was only meant to be a task that would account for 50% of Computer architecture exam mark during the first semester of VU ISE. It was revived by me only a few days ago: a few fatal bugs were fixed, the database and PHP files received a new host, some of SQL queries were improved. Due to poor time planning, miscommunication and lack of constant team structure the project currently lacks a lot of planned features and does not really function as intended:

- No real functionality behind the calendar section of the app, only the visual part
- Jobs selection section does not load jobs properly - requires switching between months to display them

## My involvement in the project and the purposes of this repository
During the development of this app I was responsible for managing and linking the database both server-wise(certain sql queries/operations stored in php files) and app-wise (string requests). The app communicates with the database by sending certain op-codes through given endpoints. The current purposes of this repository are:

- Valid proof of my ability to work with SQL and databases
- A perfect sandbox to test newly acquired knowledge
- A project which I could try to complete as I learn new things about Kotlin/SQL/PHP
